# Microsoft Cognitive Services Swift SDK

This repo contains a SDK and a sample project for [Microsoft Cognitive Services](<https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services>) written in Swift since Microsoft doesn't provide one.
If you are looking for the Windows, Android or Phython SDK you can find them [here](<https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/sdk-sample>).

The repo contains a client SDK for the following areas (Work in progress):  

### Analyze an image

This module will produce visual features based on the input image's visual
content -- image categories, pornographic detection, dominant color, and more.

-   Use the adult and racy features to enable automated restriction of sexual
    content and protect your users.

-   Utilize categorization to help append tags to images, as well as group
    images into clusters.

-   Describe images in complete sentences and recognize celebrities that appear in
    photos.

### Generate a thumbnail (Coming Soon)

Given an input image, you will be able to generate a high quality and storage
efficient thumbnail.

-   Leverage thumbnail generation to help present images in the best form suited
    to your needs.

-   Use smart cropping for thumbnails that are different than the aspect ratio
    of your original image in order to preserve the region of interest.

### OCR

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) detects text in an image and extracts the
recognized characters into a machine-usable character stream.

-   Run on embedded images to generate text and enable searching.

-   Allow users to take photos of text instead of transcribing to save time and
    effort.

### The rest is Comming Soon üòÄ #HelpAppreciated
